# ROS-Based-Autonomus-Mobile-Robot-with-3D-Mapping-System
This repository contains the implementation details, source code, and documentation for an autonomous differential drive mobile robot platform developed using ROS. The project includes a 3D mapping system utilizing a 3D LiDAR sensor mounted on a servo motor for high-resolution point cloud generation. For more details about the mapping system you can visit my [3D LiDAR Rotation System](https://github.com/omerdurmus61/3D-LiDAR-Rotation-System-Design?tab=readme-ov-file#system-architecture) project repository.
